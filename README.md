A comprehensive and secure RESTful API for a Driving and Vehicle License Department (DVLD) system. This project provides a robust backend solution for managing the entire lifecycle of driver licensing, from initial application to renewal and administrative actions. It is built with a focus on security, performance, and maintainability using modern .NET technologies.

## About The Project

This API is designed to handle all core operations of a driver licensing authority. It manages personal records, license applications, various types of driving tests, and different license classes, all while ensuring data integrity and secure access. The system is based on the detailed requirements for a DVLD project provided by Programming Advices.

### Core Services ðŸ“œ

* **People Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for individuals in the system, ensuring no duplicate national IDs exist.
* **Application Management:** Handles various application types, including:
    * New Driving License (First Time)
    * License Renewal
    * Replacement for Lost or Damaged License
    * International License Issuance
* **Multi-Class Licensing:** Supports a wide range of license categories, such as motorcycles, personal cars, commercial vehicles, buses, and trucks, each with its own fees, validity period, and age requirements.
* **Test & Appointment System:** Manages the three-step testing process (Vision, Written, and Practical), including appointment scheduling, fee collection, and result tracking.
* **License Management:** Complete control over licenses, including issuance, renewal, detainment, and release functionalities.
* **User Administration:** Securely manage system users, their personal information, and access permissions (RBAC).

### Technical Features ðŸš€

* **Secure Authentication:** Implemented using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** with support for **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **refresh tokens** to ensure secure and persistent user sessions.
* **Robust Architecture:** Utilizes the **Repository and Unit of Work patterns** for a clean, decoupled data access layer with **Entity Framework Core**.
* **Performance Optimized:** Includes response **caching** to reduce database load, **rate limiting** to prevent API abuse, and **health check endpoints** for easy monitoring and container orchestration.
* **Integrated Notifications:** Employs **SendGrid** for sending transactional emails and **Twilio** for critical SMS alerts to users.
* **Structured Logging:** Uses **Serilog** for detailed and structured application logging, enabling efficient diagnostics and monitoring.

* **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
* **ORM:** Entity Framework Core 8
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
